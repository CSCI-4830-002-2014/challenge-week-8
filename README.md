# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

It was so damn long!!! I understand that we should have started earlier, but I put a good deal of effort into this assignment, I'm a slower learner than most, and this just took a very long time.

## Describe briefly the "motivation" and "intended audience" of this public visualization (4 points).

The first one just shows an incredible visualization of flight patterns across the USA over a given 24 hour period. It's most incredible around 7am when you see the eastern part of the country explode with traffic. I'm not sure how useful this is, I just think it's very fun to see. I would love to know how the data is collected and what's used to display it.

The second link is to a fun website that shows that every few seconds, at least two people hit "play" on the exact same song at the exact same time on Spotify around the globe. Again, I don't see the importance here, but it's just a small glimpse into how much data Spotify has.
