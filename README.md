Getting the html files to successfully open through Chrome took me a bit since little things in the Checkpoint codes were wrong. I got it fixed, but it took a while.

## Describe briefly the "motivation" and "intended audience" of this public visualization (4 points).

The motivation behind this was to link Excel files relative to geographic locations to be used with Bing and create visualizations. Anyone can use it that is interested in visual statistics relating to geo-locations and whatever an individual's data is testing.
