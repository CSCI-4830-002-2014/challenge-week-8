[The art of big data.](http://www.itworld.com/article/2718862/big-data/the-art-of-big-data.html)

## Describe briefly the "motivation" and "intended audience" of this public visualization (4 points).

This article contains a TedTalk by Jer Thorp. Thorp converts data into emotional forms of art.  He believes that doing this gives it “meaning.” Visualizing the data graphically, interactively, and over time in a certain way can give the data a human context.  Individuals can and should relate to this data because it shows us our own relationship with humans and society.

Thorp helped create an open-source tool called “Processing,” which helps create visualization.

Unlike most big data visualizations, which are directed towards businesses or developers, the intended audience of this “art” is your “everyday” person.
