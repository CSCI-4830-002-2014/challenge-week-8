# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

Challenge 1 was the most challenging for me because it was open and I was not caught up on d3.
Overall this was the most challenging assignment so far, and took a long time and a lot of late nights.

## Describe briefly the "motivation" and "intended audience" of this public visualization (4 points).

First of all, I wasn't positive if this question was asking for a physical display or just something publically accessible.
I'm sorry if I did this wrong.

This census data display highlights the fields with lots of jobs and what majors end up working.
I would guess this is to encourage people to pursue STEM education and careers, as they have the most jobs available.
The intended audience is probably young people who have not decided on a field so that they are influenced
to pursue a major with jobs available.   Ideally high school or young college age individuals would be the most
influenced.
